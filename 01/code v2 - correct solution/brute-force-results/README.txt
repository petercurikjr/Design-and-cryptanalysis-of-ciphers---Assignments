percentages are not calculated correctly. ignore them. the script used all 8 cores of the processor to break the cipher concurrently. for every 10 million keys tried, the core reports its progress into the file core_X.txt. the core which finds the correct key writes the plaintext as well as the correct key into its file. the key is in decimal format, convert to hex when using decryption tools. one core (core_1) apparently got stuck in the cracking process. reasons are unknown.
